<p class="description__text">Reap the advantages of a flat diaphragm tweeter cone. This provides
  a fast response rate <br> and excellent high frequencies that lower tiered
  bookshelf speakers cannot provide. The <br> woofers are made from aluminum that
  produces a unique and clear sound. XLR inputs allow <br> you to connect to a
  mixer for more advanced usage.</p>
<p class="description__text">The ZX7 speaker is the perfect blend of
  stylish design and high performance. It houses an <br> encased MDF wooden
  enclosure which minimises acoustic resonance. Dual connectivity <br> allows pairing through bluetooth or traditional optical and RCA input. Switch input sources <br> and control volume at your finger tips with the included wireless remote. This versatile <br> speaker is equipped to deliver an authentic listening
  experience. </p>
